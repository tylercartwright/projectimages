# projectimages
For use in my Typora-Markor-Syncthing workflow to host images I display in my project notes.
# What is this?
I use this repository just to host images. I link to them in some markdown files that I store on my computer, tablets, and phone.
# What are the markdown files for?
The markdown files are my project files. If I read a book and want to take notes, I make a project file. If I am studying a new skill and want to have a roadmap for myself, I make a project file. If I am developing a website, I make a project file.

I use Typora to create the markdown files because it is extremely lightweight and responsive. Opening a file is instant, and formatting is handled visually. The files autosave, at which point Syncthing picks them up and copies them over to my devices within 15 seconds.
